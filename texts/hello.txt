Remember, terminal input can be finicky, and the exact behavior can depend on your terminal emulator and OS. The handling for Ctrl + Backspace might not work universally in all terminal environments due to different keybindings and interpretations. If this doesn't work as expected in your environment, you may need to adjust based on the specific key events your terminal generates.
